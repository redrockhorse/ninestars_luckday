# ‰πùÊòüÊ∞óÂ≠¶ (Nine Stars Ki-gaku) Calculator

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that implements the Japanese Nine Stars Ki-gaku (‰πùÊòüÊ∞óÂ≠¶) year/month/day family star chart calculator.

## About Nine Stars Ki-gaku

Nine Stars Ki-gaku is a traditional Japanese divination system based on the nine stars (‰πùÊòü) that correspond to the nine numbers in the Lo Shu magic square.
